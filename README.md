# Crop-Recommendation-System
The Crop Recommendation System is a web-based application that helps farmers and agriculture enthusiasts choose the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions.
This system uses Machine Learning with Python (Flask backend) and a web interface built with HTML to provide crop recommendations.

Technologies Used:-
Backend: Python, Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
Dataset: Agriculture crop dataset
Version Control: GitHub.

How It Works:-
The user enters input values such as:
Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
Temperature
Humidity
pH value
Rainfall
The data is sent to the Flask backend.
The trained Machine Learning model processes the input.
The system predicts and displays the best crop to grow.
